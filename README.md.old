# dijkstra_demo
This is a thoroughly commented adaptation of the Cornell Dijkstra's Algorithm code.

The modifications include:
- the conversion of a fixed 128x128 graph data structure to a variable sized (but still dense) vector.
- the addition of a file format to read in graph definitions.
- the secret sauce needed to reconstitute paths from within dijkstra()
